Note that unless you control the volume of your

clipping of the audio samples, and thus in distortion.
No dynamic range compression is applied whatsoever.

Each source only has to have a single output buffer,
which is then interpreted as a point audio source. If
you require different shapes of sources, you can get
that behaviour by modifying the location of the source
relative to the listener in such a way that the
closest point of the source's shape is the actual point
the source has. This won't account for overlapping and
such finer details of sound, but should be good enough
for most cases.

Note that unlike in CL-MIXED, where each source is
independent of the mixer, and you thus have to use the
INPUT-LOCATION/VELOCITY functions to adjust their
parameters, in Harmony the sources are tied to a mixer
and you can thus use the same LOCATION and VELOCITY
functions for sources as you would for the mixer. In
the case of the mixer, the location and velocity are
to be interpreted as those of the listener.

will result in degraded output quality for some
operations like fading. Note that having a sample
rate that differs from your inputs or the output
device will likely result in bad audio quality and
distortions, as the audio data needs to be
resampled.
